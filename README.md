# WorldCupPicker

This is a little randomiser app that i have created for a side project at work. This enables you to input the participants names into the array and generate the
teams for people to be assigned.

It will work out the number of people and give them all an even amount of teams; however if there aren't enough people I opted to give some teams to a charity
and they could win the competition themselves.

MVP is there but going to look at improving as and when I get time
